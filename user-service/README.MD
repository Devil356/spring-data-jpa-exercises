Improve your *Spring Data JPA* Java configuration skills
### Task
The task is to **implement `UserService` using `UserRepository`**. In order to do that, you need to **provide all required 
configuration, implement methods, and create custom repository**. Please follow the instructions in the *todo* section.

To verify your configuration, run `UserServiceAppTest.java`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with *Spring IoC* and *Dependency injection*

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
